# asteroids_html5

I have used this game in my one-semester JavaScript class.  I am in the process of rewriting the code and text on this game; reorganizing and updating to Javascript ES2018.  We built this game collaboratively.  I am proud of what the kids did, but the code is really clunky at this point.

Recently, my students built this game on the Codepen platform.  Here's the link:  https://codepen.io/dwbento/pen/jObYjaE  You can see the code that was used during that semester project.  

I am currently rewriting the code to be more Object-Oriented.  Once the code is finished, I will write some text that guides you and your students through the creation of this game.

Enjoy!!

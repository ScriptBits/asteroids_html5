I have used this game in my one-semester JavaScript class.  I am in the process of rewriting the code and text on this game; reorganizing and updating to Javascript ES2018.  We built this game collaboratively.  I am proud of what the kids did, but the code is really clunky at this point.

Recently, my students built this game on the Codepen platform.  Here's the link: https://codepen.io/dwbento/pen/KKdorLK  You can see the older code that was used during that semester project.  To see the new code, which is changing little by little, here's the codepen link: https://codepen.io/dwbento/pen/JjExVLg  As I find time to updae the code and the text documents, you will see more functionality in the game.

Once finished, the code will be much more object-oriented.

Enjoy!!
